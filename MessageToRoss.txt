Hi Ross,
I've tried to send you an email (one I found here) it doesn't work. I've tried to upload files to github, it seemingly did it but the files doesn't show on web interface. 
I feel really poorly, I've used up about a box of papertissues already. I won't show up today. 

If you read this please send me a contact to pass the file to you.

All the best,
Gary
